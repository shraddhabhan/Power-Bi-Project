#Earthquake 1900-2013 Data Visualization
Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing global earthquake data from 1900 to 2013. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains information on earthquakes, including their locations, magnitudes, and depths. Through this project, I aimed to uncover patterns and trends in earthquake occurrences over time and across different regions.

Dataset
Source: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekchauhan001/earthquake-1900-2013.
Contents: The dataset includes details such as:
Date and time of the earthquake
Location (latitude, longitude)
Magnitude
Depth
Project Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:

To analyze the frequency and distribution of earthquakes over the years.
To identify regions with the highest seismic activity.
To explore correlations between earthquake magnitude and depth.
To visualize the data in a way that highlights key insights and trends.
Visualization
The data has been transformed into interactive visualizations using Power BI. Key visualizations include:

Magnitude Type: Visual representation of different types of earthquake magnitudes recorded in the dataset.
Total Earthquake: A visualization showing the total number of earthquakes recorded in the dataset.
Select the Year: An interactive filter that allows users to select a specific year and view earthquake data for that year.
Total Earthquake by Magnitude: A breakdown of the total number of earthquakes categorized by magnitude.
Total Earthquake by Place: A visualization that shows the total number of earthquakes by geographic location.
Depth and Magnitude Relationship: A scatter plot or other visual showing the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude.
Total Earthquake by Month: A chart illustrating the number of earthquakes per month.
Depth Histogram: A histogram displaying the distribution of earthquake depths.
Total Earthquake by Year: A line chart or bar chart showing the total number of earthquakes per year.
