Power BI Projects
Welcome to my Power BI Projects repository! This is a collection of projects I've undertaken to hone my skills in data visualization and analytics using Power BI. Each project represents a different aspect of my learning journey, from data exploration to dashboard creation.

Repository Structure
I've organized this repository into different branches, with each branch dedicated to a specific Power BI project. This structure allows you to explore each project independently, including the data, visuals, and insights associated with it.
