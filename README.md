Hello everyone,
I have created this Power BI Dashboard Project: Unveiling Trends in Amazon Prime Content
Project Objective:
This project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard that analyzes data on Amazon Prime's vast library of movies and TV shows. By leveraging a rich dataset encompassing details like cast, directors, ratings, release year, and duration, this dashboard provides valuable insights into content trends and user preferences.
Tools Used:
•	Microsoft Power BI
•	Data Source: Kaggle Dataset (Amazon Prime Content)
Amazon Prime Content Analysis with Power BI:
•	Developed an interactive dashboard to explore the expansive Amazon Prime content library.
•	Analyzed details like country,directors, ratings, release year, and duration to uncover trends in content offerings.
•	Gained insights into user preferences and content consumption patterns on the platform.
Key Insights:
• Genre Distribution: The dashboard shows that Drama is the most popular genre on Prime Video, followed by Comedy and then Action & Drama (combining these two categories). This suggests that Prime Video users prefer content in these genres.
•Ratings by Genre: The scatter plot seems to indicate that there is no clear correlation between ratings and the number of shows in a particular genre. This could be an interesting area to explore further to see if there are any outliers or specific genres that tend to have higher or lower ratings.
•Total Shows by Release Year: The line chart suggests that the number of titles on Prime Video has increased significantly over the past two years (from 1950 to 2000). This indicates that Prime Video is constantly adding new content to its library.
•Content Type: The donut chart shows that the majority of content on Prime Video is Movies (80.82%), with TV Shows making up the remaining 19.18%.
Benefits:
•	Gain data-driven insights into content trends and user preferences on Amazon Prime.
•	Identify opportunities to improve content acquisition and recommendation strategies.
•	Enhance user experience by tailoring content offerings to their preferences.
